TCP server:

socket()              create the server-side socket (endpoint)
bind()                bind (associate) a specific port number with the socket,
                       which will be the listener port
listen()              identify the socket as a TCP listener, meaning it will
                       be ready to accept() incoming client connection requests

while ( 1 )
{
  accept()            accept an incoming client connection request (BLOCKING)

  /* either call fork() or pthread_create() here to spawn a process/thread
     to handle the new connection via the returned socket descriptor */

  CHILD:
    recv()/send()       read/write data across the established connection
    read()/write()
    exit() or pthread_exit()

  PARENT:
    close()            close the socket descriptor
}



TCP client:

socket()              create the client-side socket (endpoint)
connect()             attempt to establish a connection to the specified
                       server and port number via TCP

recv()/send()         read/write data across the established connection
read()/write()

close()               close the socket descriptor

===========================================================================

SERVER TYPES:

(0) Iterative server (typically UDP): Accept incoming UDP datagrams on 
     a specific port number. Or we accept and process TCP connections one
      at a time sequentially (e.g. tcp-server.c, udp-server.c)

      i.e. a single main thread processes all client requests.

(1) fork()-based server (e.g. tcp-server-fork.c): a child process is created
     to process every TCP client connection.

(2) fork()-based server with pre-forked processes: pre-fork() n processes, 
     then as TCP client commection requests come in, assign them to child
      processes (which requires synchronization ... maybe a Counting Semaphore?)

(3) thread()-based server (e.g. tcp-server-fork.c): a child process is created
     to process every TCP client connection.

(4) thread()-based server with pre-created threads: (i.e. thread pool) pre-create() 
     n threads, then as TCP client commection requests come in, assign them to child
      thread (which requires synchronization ... maybe a Counting Semaphore?)

(5) select-based server: a single process (no multi-threading/multi-processing) that 
     uses the select() system call, which enables the process to poll multiple
      descriptors to check for activity on any one of them.

    this eliminates the need (complexity/overhead) of multiple proceeses or 
     multiple threads

    ... this is still an iterative server

MEMORY MANAGEMENT:

Memory Manager:

-- allocate/deallocate memory for processes (NOT WITHIN PROCESSES) 
    (the OS assigns memory to new.running processes and deallocates memory)

-- protection, i.e., no access to a given process's memory space
    from outside the given process

-- shared memory management (btwn two or more processes, which could include
    shared libraries, shared memory segments created via shmget(), etc.)


Approaches:
-- Contiguous Memory Allocation
-- Noncontiguous Memory Allocation
-- Virtual Memory

With multiprogramming, multiple options for managing memory.

-- early approaches identified PARTITIONS, where a partition is a block
    of CONTIGUOUS MEMORY that can be allocated to a process

Degree of multiprogramming
-- how many processes can be in memory at once?
-- depends on process size, partition size, and the amount of memory
    available overall

A LOGICAL ADDRESS references some location within a
 given process address space
  -- think of the logical address as an offset from the
      first byte of the process memory (byte 0)

        LOAD x
 LABEL: ...
        ...
        ...
        DECR x
        BNE LABEL   ; branch up/backwards 48 bytes


  -- RELOCATABLE CODE

  -- When a process is placed into physical memory,
      its logical address space is bound to a physical memory space

The OS must map every LOGICAL ADDRESS to a PHYSICAL ADDRESS
-- logical addresses are generated by compilers/assemblers


CONTIGUOUS MEMORY ALLOCATION
-- fit the entire process address space into physical memory
    in one contiguous block

   -- this block has a BASE address (e.g., 14000) or starting point
       in physical memory, as well as a LIMIT (size in bytes)

-- Partitioned memory can be FIXED or DYNAMIC

Fixed Partitioning Scheme
-- Given N partitions of potentially different sizes
-- Each process is allocated to exactly one partition
-- Each partition is associated with one process or is marked as FREE
-- OS manages a list of free partitions and
    a mapping of used partitions to processes


MEMORY (fixed partitioning scheme):
-----------------------------------
 DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD    Partition 1  (64 memory units)
 DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD.......
-----------------------------------
 BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB    Partition 2  (64 memory units)
 BBBBBBBBBBB......................
-----------------------------------
 CCCCCCCCCC.......................    Partition 3  (256 memory units)
 .................................
 .................................
 .................................
 .................................
 .................................
 .................................
 .................................
-----------------------------------

-- if process E arrives and requires 8 memory units, we cannot allocate
    a partition for this process because all partitions are in use
     (even though we have enough memory to do so...)

Dynamic Partitioning Scheme
-- the size of a given process will define the size of the allocated partition
-- this is essentially on-demand partitioning


MEMORY (dynamic partitioning scheme):
-----------------------------------
 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBB   The set of A's defines one partition
 BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB    (for process A), the set of B's defines
 BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB     another partition, etc.

 CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC.
 ....MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
 MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM...............
 .................................   As time goes by, processes arriving
 .................FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF    and leaving the system cause the memory
 FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF     to become increasingly fragmented
 FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
 FGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG............
 ................HHHHHHHHHH.......
-----------------------------------

If process X arrives and requires more memory than the largest free
 partition, we look to defragmentation:

MEMORY (dynamic partitioning scheme):
-----------------------------------
 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBB   The set of A's defines one partition
 BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB    (for process A), the set of B's defines
 BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB     another partition, etc.

 GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHXXXXXX  As time goes by, processes arriving
 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX   and leaving the system cause the memory
 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX    to become increasingly fragmented
 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.....
-----------------------------------

We need an algorithm to determine where to place each newly arriving process
-- e.g., process Y arrives and requires 10 memory units
